== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I translate all labels and placeholders = 
Yes, WCPGSK allows you to translate all labels and placeholders

= After installation labels and placeholder do not show up. What can I do? = 
Please save the WooCommerce Poor Guys Swiss Knife Settings page (WooCommerce -> WooCommerce Poor Guys Swiss Knife) at least once.
(Starting with version 1.6.2 it's not necessary anymore to save the WooCommerce Poor Guys Swiss Knife settings after installation and first activation.)

= What field types does WooCommerce Poor Guys Swiss Knife support = 
With WooCommerce Poor Guys Swiss Knife you can support:

* Fields of type text with the sub-types via validation of: email, password
* Textarea
* Date
* Time
* Number (as simple numeric input or ranges)
* Select (with subtypes of checkboxes, radio buttons or single or multiple select boxes)

WooCommerce Rich Guys Swiss Knife offers additonal fields: file upload, color picker, product terms

With WooCommerce Poor Guys Swiss Knife you have 11 diferent custom field types available or directly or via the configuration of the main types.

= Does Poor Guys Swiss Knife limit options for selects or other custom fields = 
Not in any way. You can add as many options as you like. You can also add as many custom fields as you like.

= There's only select available, how can I create checkboxes and radio buttons = 
Checkboxes, radio buttons and selects are in fact all selections and you can define the presentation of a select field as dropdown or multiple selection box, as checkboxes or radio buttons. You only have to keep in mind the logic. Radio Buttons and dropdown selects are for single and exclusive selections, whereas a multiple choice selection box and checkboxes allow multiple selections. You can configure this in the settings of your select custom field.

= Can I deactivate the plugin without problems = 
Yes, you can. WooCommerce Poor Guys Swiss Knife does not alter in any way your WooCommerce installation. It uses hooks and filters to interact with WooCommerce.

If you uninstall the plugin after deactivation, you will lose all your customizations but WooCommerce Poor Guys Swiss Knife will not delete any data captured via customized checkout forms, only the configuration.

= Can I display all the data captured =
Yes, you can configure your added checkout form fields to show up in the administration within the order. The data is displayed on order receipts and emails as well.

If you add item customization forms using WooCommerce Rich Guys Swiss Knife your data will show up in your order inside the administration as well.

= My custom field data does not show up in emails and receipts. How can I fix this? =
You have to reconfigure what was formerly "Show in order". From version 1.5.0 onwards you have to hide the data. This is easier as the user and you expects his data to be visible by default.

= Can I reconfigure the WooCommerce standard fields? =
Yes, you can change the required status, label and placeholders or even remove the built-in WooCommerce fields, but please test your changes. Especially the email, country and postcode fields can be vital for the correct functioning of your WooCommerce instance.

= Incompatible plugins, are there? =
Yes, WooCommerce Checkout Manager is reported to be incompatible. If you run this plugin, you should not activate WooCommerce Poor Guys Swiss Knife.
Up to now, no other incompatibilities have been reported.

= There are few language translations, does this mean that I'm not able to run customizations in my language? =
Not at all. Labels, fields, everything you configure are available for translation via WPML or by your own means. If you use WPML please register your newly configured strings by activating "auto-register strings" under String Translation settings in WPML. Once registered you should deactivate this option as it consumes a lot of resources.

= I've configured a number for the items to be displayed on the shop page, but it doesn't work. What's wrong? =
Plugins like Jetpack preconfigure the main query in the context of "infinite scroll" function for example. That's not a bug, your template should display your products using "infinite scroll".
